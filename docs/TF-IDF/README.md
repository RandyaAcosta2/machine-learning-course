# TF-IDF

* What is TF-IDF?
	* term’s frequency (TF), and 
	* its inverse document frequency (IDF)

````
    TF-IDF  is an information retrieval technique 
    that weighs a term’s frequency (TF) and its 
    inverse document frequency (IDF). 
    
    Each word or term has its respective TF and IDF 
    score. The product of the TF and IDF scores of
    a term is called the TF-IDF weight of that term.
 
    Put simply, the higher the TF-IDF score (weight), 
    the rarer the term and vice versa.
