# Logistic Regression


[Logistic Regression -- wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)


````
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression 
analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is 
dichotomous (binary). Like all regression analyses, 
the logistic regression is a  predictive  analysis.  
Logistic regression is used to describe data and to 
explain the relationship between one dependent binary 
variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval 
or ratio-level independent variables.
